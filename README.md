# Traffic Light Challenge

## Problem Description

Create a simulated traffic light. The traffic light should cycle through red, yellow, and green lights automatically, mimicking the behavior of a real traffic signal.

## Requirements

1. Display three lights: red, yellow, and green.
2. Automatically cycle through the lights in the correct order (green -> yellow -> red -> green).
3. Each light should stay active for a set duration:
   - Green: 2 seconds
   - Yellow: 1 second
   - Red: 2 seconds
4. Only one light should be active at a time.
5. The cycle should repeat indefinitely.
